                <ul>
                    <li>DARK BROWN SUGAR: Adds sweetness to balance the saltiness of the soy sauce and the tanginess of
                        the vinegar.
                    </li>
                    <li>SOY SAUCE: Provides the savory, umami flavor foundation for the glaze.

                    </li>
                    <li>MIRIN (JAPANESE SWEET RICE WINE): Contributes a mild sweetness and helps to create a glossy
                        finish on the
                        glaze;<br>found in the Asian section of most supermarkets.

                    </li>
                    <li>SHERRY VINEGAR: Introduces a slight acidity to the glaze.

                    </li>
                    <li>WHOLE GRAIN MUSTARD: Adds texture and a piquant taste to the glaze,<br>plementing the other
                        flavors.
                    </li>
                    <li>WATER: Used to adjust the consistency of the glaze.
                    </li>
                    <li>CORNSTARCH: Acts as a thickener to help the glaze coat to the salmon.
                    </li>
                    <li>RED PEPPER FLAKES: Provides a hint of heat, adding another layer of flavor to the glaze.
                        <
                    </li>
                    <li>SALMON FILLETS: Try to find uniform pieces that are narrow and tall rather than wide and
                        flat—they’ll fit better in the pan and make for a much prettier presentation.<br> Also, be sure
                        they are cut into small portions (6 ounces or less),<br> otherwise they’ll be difficult to cook
                        fully on the stovetop.
                    </li>
                    <li>VEGETABLE OIL: Used for cooking; it has a high smoke point, making it ideal for searing the
                        salmon.
                    </li>
                </ul>

    <h4>STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by making the glaze, which is adapted from Cook’s Illustrated. In a saucepan, combine the brown sugar,<br>
            soy sauce, mirin, sherry vinegar, whole grain mustard, water, corn starch and red pepper flakes.<br>
            Be sure to do this off the heat; the corn starch will not dissolve in hot liquid and you don’t want lumps.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then simmer until thickened, about a minute.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Meawshile, season the salmon fillets with
            salt.
        </li>
        <li>Place the salmon in the hot pan. Cook until golden brown on the first side, about 4 minutes.<br>
            Then turn the fish over with a spatula,
            reduce the heat to medium and then cook until the fillets feel firm to the touch, 3 to 4 minutes more.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer the fillets to a platter or plates.

        </li>
        </li>
        <li>Top them generously with the glaze. You’ll have plenty of extra glaze;<br>
            it makes a terrific sauce for whatever else you’re serving with the fish.

        </li>
